            </blockquote>
            <p>They actually copied the technical details. It's well explained in the section titled "<a href="#how">How Apple copying our work?</a>".</p>
            <p>For example, This is our patent claim:</p>

            <p>This is what Apple <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/usage-guidelines-for-websites-and-other-platforms/">guidelines</a> page say,</p>

            <h2>The Short Version</h2>
            <p>My name is Viruthagiri Thirumavalavan. I'm the founder and principal engineer of Dombox, a privacy-focused, spamless mail system. </p>
            <p>In February 2019, I published my entire research in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dombox.org/dombox.pdf">a 300-page white paper</a> and shared it in a big engineering mailing list to gather feedback. </p>
            <p>There was a quarrel between a few engineers and me. One of them is an Apple engineer. That thread was a hot topic at that time. I thought that was over. But Apple seem like copied my work brick-by-brick from my white paper, released it as "Sign in with Apple" without my permission in June 2019.</p>
            <p>I have tried to reason with Apple privately. But they are completely denying it's my work. "Sign in with Apple" deals with registration, login and email communication. Those are the blood vessels for an internet business. If "Sign in with Apple" breaks, then it's gonna cause economical issues. So, I'm disclosing everything here as a last resort to warn the public.</p>

        <h1 id="what" class="text-primary mb-4 text-center" style="line-height: 1.3;">What exactly Apple copied?</h1>
        <div class="border-bottom pb-3 mb-4">
            <p>The following table describes the list of ideas copied from the paper I published. For the sake of clarity, I published my white paper in February 2019. Apple released "Sign in with Apple" in June 2019.</p>
            <p>The column "Teleport" describes the original version from my white paper. [Note: "Teleport" is renamed as "Sign In with Dombox" for better branding.]</p>
            <p>"OAuth Clients" are termed as "Portals". </p>
            <p>A domain that supports our "Teleport" button is termed as "Portal Partner / Teleport Partner".</p>

                <p>We have adopted this policy due in
                    part to the large volume of information received and to avoid potential misunderstandings
                    or disputes when Apple's products or marketing strategies might seem similar to ideas
                    made available to Apple.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>They actually announced a product with (a) exact steps as mine (b) exact strategy as mine (c) in the exact year as mine.  But that's the best version they could come up with for copying my product (Teleport) and marketing strategy (Mandating button).</p>
            <p>Ideas don't fall from the tree. For an inventor, it takes a very long time to come up with these ideas. Each and every step of the product conceived at a different point of time to address different issues.  </p>
            <p>I actually started my research in 2013. It was called "XMail" at that time. I even tried to acquire the domain xmail.com in 2014</p>
            <div class="shadow-lg rounded mb-3 text-center">
                <img class="img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/xmail.png" >
            </div>
            <p>I made good progress by 2016. The word "XMail" already trademarked by someone. So I changed the name to "Dombox" in 2016. I applied for trademark and described the meaning of the words "Dom" and "box".</p>

            <p>My point is, when I published my paper in Feb 2019, there was a 5 year history. The ideas they found in my paper is the final iteration of my work. There were many failed iteration before. </p>
            <p>So when "David Schumann" say, they built "Sign in with Apple" without reference to any of my information or writings, he is talking about some kind of "miracle". </p>

            <p>When I started my research in 2013, I only wanted to find a way to address email spam issues without relying on spam filters. But along the way, I found a way to address privacy issues too. So Apple copying only the "intermediate" part of my system.</p>

                <h2>Domboxes</h2>
                <p>Domboxes deal with "Non-Conversational Mails".</p>
                <p>Dombox is the short form for "Domain-based Isolated Mailbox". </p>
                <p>Users are gonna create a separate mailbox for each domain. Each of this separated (i.e. Isolated) mailbox is called Dombox.</p>
                <p>The following image shows the dombox address structure.</p>

                </div>
                <p><b>Dombox Domain</b> - By default, dombox can accept mails only from the domain it was created for. Since the domain is tied to the Dombox address it is called "Dombox Domain".</p>
                <p><b>Domkey</b> - Domkey stands for "Dombox Global Keyword". i.e. All Dombox addresses gonna use this key to make them unique. Domkey is a unique string just like a username. You set this only once. You need to set the Domkey before creating your first Dombox.
                    <a target="_blank" href="../assets/images/domkey.png">This is how</a> you set Domkey.</p>
                <p><b>New Dombox</b> - <a target="_blank" href="../assets/images/newdombox.png">This is how</a> you create Dombox.</p>

            <div class="border-bottom pb-3 mb-4">
                <h2>Sender Alias Domains (SAD)</h2>
                <p>Now let’s go back to our dombox address structure.</p>
                <p>{Dombox Domain}@{Domkey}.{Receiver Domain}</p>
                <p>Let's create a Dombox for "google.com". The created Dombox address would look like this.</p>
                <p>google.com@giri123.domboxmail.com</p>
                <p>The above address can accept mails only from google.com</p>

                <h3>Direct Pass</h3>
                <p>When the Sending Domain == Dombox Domain</p>
                <p>MAIL FROM:&lt;accounts@<span style="color: #377dff">google.com</span>&gt;</p>
                <p>RCPT TO:&lt;<span style="color: #377dff">google.com</span>@giri123.domboxmail.com&gt;</p>
                <p>Sending Domain: google.com</p>
                <p>Dombox Domain: google.com</p>
                <div class="mb-3 text-center">
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/dpass.png" >
                </div>
                <p>We make sure the incoming mails are not spoofed by fetching SPF record from google.com. After this process, the mail will be accepted without any issues. Thus, it is a direct pass.</p>

                <h3>Indirect Pass</h3>
                <p>When the Sending Domain ≠ Dombox Domain, then we go for indirect check.</p>
                <p>Google's primary domain is google.com. But Google owns hundreds of other domains as well. e.g. adsense.com, adwords.com, youtube.com etc.</p>
                <p>We cannot force the user to create a separate Dombox for each domain. On the other hand, we cannot force Google to send mails only from google.com.</p>
                <p>There should be some flexibility. Hence, I introduced a new DNS TXT record type called "SAD Record". If you are familiar with SPF record, then it’s the same thing. But for whitelisting domains instead of IP addresses. SPF deals with MAIL FROM domain. SAD deals with RCPT TO domain. So it can be termed as "Receiver Policy Framework".</p>
                <p>Just to be clear, the SAD record is related to domboxes and it needs to be placed in the "Dombox Domain".</p>
                <p>google.com@giri123.domboxmail.com => google.com is the "Dombox Domain"</p>
                <p>MAIL FROM:&lt;noreply@<span style="color: #377dff">youtube.com</span>></p>
                <p>RCPT TO:&lt;<span style="color: #377dff">google.com</span>@giri123.domboxmail.com></p>
                <p>Sending Domain: youtube.com</p>

                <p>To allow mail from "noreply@youtube.com" to the google.com dombox, google.com should have the following SAD record in _sad.google.com</p>

            <p>Apple copying my work by forcing their "App Store" developers to support "Sign in with Apple". Most of them have no idea how patent works.</p>
            <p>The following is a response from a "Sign in with Apple" developer when I tried to explain him what's going on.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Email masking has been around forever. You've thought of nothing new, save some weird proprietary &lt;thing> to make your patent seemingly valid. You’d have no case anywhere since it’s in common use by many, many, many companies and has been for a long time.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>You get patent for inventive steps. Not for an entire category.</strong></p>
            <p>If you don't know how patent works, then expand this section to get a quick overview about patents. <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#pat-basics-dec" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">Toggle</a></p>

            <div class="collapse" id="pat-basics-dec">
                <p>Patentability mainly focuses on two things. Novelty and Non-Obviousness. In some countries, the latter part is called as "Inventive Step".</p>
                <p><b>Novelty</b> - The "Novelty" principle asks whether the invention was known to the public "exactly as described" before the filing date of the patent application. Novelty is straightforward. You either invented something or you don't.</p>
                <p><b>Non-Obviousness</b> - The "Non-Obviousness" principle asks whether the invention is an adequate distance beyond what's already known to the public. </p>
                <p>Determining "Non-Obviousness" is extremely hard. So courts sometimes rely on secondary considerations for determining non-obviousness. To quote Federal Circuit which is known for its decisions on patent law, "evidence of secondary considerations may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record". </p>
                <p>So "non-obviousness" deals with questions like (1) Is the invention commercially successful? (2) Did others fail before? (3) Are people praising the invention, especially competitors? (4) Did the invention recognize a problem that has never been recognized before? (5) Are competitors trying to copy the invention? etc.</p>
                <p><b>Prior Art</b> - One way or another, all form of invention rely on already known ideas. For example, my "Teleport" button [or "Sign in with Apple" button if you prefer], is an improvement over buttons like "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with Facebook". </p>
                <p>If your invention do not have any prior art, that means you either ahead of its time (e.g. Someone invented an iPhone in the 18th century) OR you are not working on a notable problem i.e. If the problem is notable, then others tried to solve it and failed.</p>
                <p>Any publicly available evidence which is close to the invention is called as "Prior Art". In my invention's case, it is <a target="_blank" href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/2e/8e/8b/51b9b098ca0464/WO2014105263A1.pdf">WO2014105263A1</a>. Apple copied my work with the help of that document. So from this point forward, the term "Prior Art" refers to WO2014105263A1.</p>
                <p><b>Provisional Rights</b> - "Provisional rights" allow a patent owner to collect damages from the infringers for activities occurring between "the date of the patent application publication" and "the patent granting date". </p>
                <p><b>Patent</b> - A patent is a government license that exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention without the inventor's permission for a limited period of time. This period is usually 20 years. Patent system's main purpose is to encourage innovation. A patented cancer cure is better than not having a cure at all. </p>
                <p><b>Patent Infringement</b> - Patent infringement occurs once the patent get granted. Patent laws are country-specific. Under US law,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271">35 U.S. Code § 271</a> states the following:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.</p>
                    <p>(b) Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><b>Direct Infringement</b> - It occurs when the main party makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells the invention without the inventor's permission.  </p>
                <p>The term "main party" depends on the claim language. From the Apple perspective "Sign in with Apple" is a product. From the Developer perspective "Sign in with Apple" is a "medium" for sending mails. The "main party or parties" doesn't need to know that a patent exists in order to be held liable.</p>
                <p><b>Indirect Infringement</b> - Secondary liability, or indirect infringement, arises when a party materially contributes to, facilitates, induces, or is otherwise responsible for infringing acts carried out by the main party.</p>
                <p><b>Induced Infringement</b> - A form of Indirect Infringement where the party "cause[s], urge[s], encourage[s], or aid[s]" the infringing acts carried out by the main party. e.g. media articles and bloggers who goes like this. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3452840/why-you-should-begin-using-sign-in-with-apple.html">Why you should begin using Sign in with Apple</a></p>

                    <p>In countries like US, you can have "<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_method_patent">business method patents</a>". Business method patents are a class of patents which disclose and claim new methods of doing business. e.g.
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Click" target="_blank">Amazon One-Click patent</a>.</p>
                    <p>Since we are a startup, I had to come up with a unique business method to acquire more developers. I actually spent more than an year in shaping that idea. <a target="_blank" href="../products/contract">Here is the full version</a> of that idea.</p>
                    <p>Since we are dealing with "Developer Acquisition", The value of this "business method" lies in the early years. When it comes to getting a patent, it takes many years due to backlog. By the time we get the patent, Apple would have captured the entire market with our idea. That's their plan. </p>

                    <p>See the "prior art" screenshot. The "domain policy list" part is quite vague in the prior art. That part can be interpreted as "list of redirect URLs of a domain", but also can be argued as a "list of domains". i.e. "domain policy list" = "domain list". Apple going for the latter part. Let's just assume Apple's interpretation is correct.</p>
                    <p>My system deals with emails. So the developer provide a "list of domains" for the purpose of "sending emails". In the prior art, the developer provide a "list of domains" for the purpose of preventing "fake apps". Apple copying that step, so they can argue that as "obvious".</p>
                    <p>There is one problem here. My "list of domains" deals with "envelope domains".</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 pt-3 border-top">Envelope Domains</h2>
                    <p>Email is a hop-by-hop protocol. Meaning there can be multiple mail handling servers in
                        between the sending server and the receiving server. e.g. Retrying server, Spam checking
                        server, Virus scanning server etc. So the SMTP protocol was designed to mimic our physical postal system. i.e. Anyone can
                        be able to transmit emails for the domain they don't own. So "envelope domain" refers to the "postman". Not the "original sender".</p>
                    <p>The following are some of the examples of "envelope domain". Pay attention to the "mailed-by" part. That's the entity carrying the mail. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the "from" part you see in the screenshot is the "original sender".</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 pt-3 border-top">Domain Verification</h2>
                    <p>The term "domain policy list" in the prior art refers to developer's "own domains". i.e. The developer provides their own domains to prevent fake apps. But "envelope domains" mainly deals with "third-party domains" in my version. So prior art version is not compatible with my version. </p>
                    <p>Apple's idea is to force all developers to use only their own domains. Pay attention to the "verify" option in all domains. By asking verification in all domains, they can make sure these domains are owned by the developer.</p>
                    <div class="rounded mb-3 text-center">
                        <img class="shadow-lg img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/eda.png" >
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 pt-3 border-top">Verify all domains, even subdomains</h2>
                    <p>In my invention the developer verify only the primary domain (i.e. The domain associated with the OAuth App). This is because, the domain owner use the DNS to provide additional domains.  Apple asks the developer to verify all domains even subdomains to circumvent my invention.</p>
                    <div class="rounded mb-3 text-center">
                        <img class="shadow-lg img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/aed.png" >
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 pt-3 border-top">Known trusted place</h2>
                    <p>Apple trying to convert "known trusted place" as "known verified domain". That's the reason they are going for domain verification.</p>
                    <div class="rounded mb-3 text-center">
                        <img class="shadow-lg img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/tp.png" >
                    </div>
                    <p>Interpretation has to be reasonable and consistent with the specification. The term "known trusted place" refers to "trusted information that only server would know" in the prior art.</p>
                    <div class="rounded mb-3 text-center">
                        <img class="shadow-lg img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/ktp.png" >
                    </div>
                    <p>So Apple's argument here is the "list of domains" are "verified domains". Also the main domain in step #4. </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 pt-3 border-top">HTTP Verification</h2>
                    <p>My white paper disclosed the <a target="_blank" href="../assets/images/apple/127.jpg">DNS-based</a> verification method. So they are going for the HTTP verification method.</p>
                    <div class="rounded mb-3 text-center">
                        <img class="shadow-lg img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/eda.png" >
                    </div>


                    <h1 class="mt-5 pt-3 border-top text-center text-primary">Web Platform</h1>
                    <p>Apple has a <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/usage-guidelines-for-websites-and-other-platforms/">separate guidelines page</a> for Websites and Other Platforms</p>
                    <h2 class="mt-5 pt-3 border-top">System-Provided Javascript</h2>
                    <div class="rounded mb-3 text-center">
                        <img class="shadow-lg img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/swjs.png" >
                    </div>
                    <p>If you are a developer, there is a higher chance "a system-provided javascript API" part may sound odd to you. That text is added there to justify their case. </p>
                    <p>Let's go back to the prior art. The "domain policy list" in the prior art is provided for preventing fake "mobile" apps. That means, the scope is limited to the "mobile platform". But, Apple wants the "Sign in with Apple" to be cross-platform. Especially they want "Sign in with Apple" to be accessible on the web. </p>
                    <p>My white paper heavily uses "web platform" as example for describing my entire invention. Apple is looking for "gaps" here to copy my work.</p>

                    <p>The primary reason they are betting on "Sign in with Apple JS" is because they missed a key point. When Apple released their product in June 2019, they had access to only my published white paper. The provisional application I filed before publishing my white paper actually had more content. It was not public at that time.</p>
                    <p>The following part is the primary reason why Apple betting on "Sign in with Apple JS".</p>
                    <div class="rounded mb-3 text-center">

                    </div>
                    <p>Apple thought I didn't cover the "javascript-based" part in my invention. But I actually covered that part in the provisional application I filed before publishing my white paper.</p>
                    <div class="rounded mb-3 text-center">

                        <h2>Caution</h2>
                        <p class="alert-text">If you are a developer, keep these things in mind if you support "Sign in with Apple".</p>
                        <p class="alert-text">(1) The present version of "Sign in with Apple" requires you to place an App on their "App Store" to use it in websites and other platforms. [If you are one of the early adopters of "Sign in with Apple", they didn't perform this check. So there is higher chance you maybe violating our IP.] </p>
                        <p class="alert-text">(2) If you get banned from App Store OR you voluntarily remove your app from their App Store, you cannot display "Sign in with Apple" in websites and other platforms. </p>
                        <p class="alert-text">(3) If you get banned from App Store OR you voluntarily remove your app from their App Store, you cannot send emails to your EXISTING "Sign in with Apple" users. </p>
                        <p class="alert-text">(4) Apple had a history of banning apps from the App Store and it's ugly. e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/email-app-returns-to-mac-app-store-after-8-month-fight-with-apple/">Email app returns to Mac App Store after 8-month fight with Apple</a>. </p>
                        <p class="alert-text">(5) Apple <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/usage-guidelines-for-websites-and-other-platforms/">guidelines</a> says: </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p class="alert-text">Apple reserves the right to disable Sign in with Apple on a website or app for any reason at any time.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="alert-text">(6) In the future, "Sign in with Apple" probably not gonna work properly in other platforms, especially web and Android. So it's not really a cross platform product. </p>
                        <p class="alert-text">(7) All illegal products comes with liabilities. So it's a big liability for your business. Apple covers only upto $50 for damages. So understand the consequences before supporting "Sign in with Apple". At 200% zoom, you can see this part in the last page of their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Sign_in_with_Apple_White_Paper_Nov_2019.pdf">white paper</a>.</p>

                        <p class="alert-text mb-0">(8) You probably violating our provisional rights at the moment and gonna infringe our patents if it get granted. That's something you should take seriously. Apple not going to indemnify you.</p>

                    <p>SPF was <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4408">introduced</a> in 2006. DKIM was <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4871">introduced</a> in 2007. But the email system we use today, was
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821">introduced</a> in 1982. So when both SPF and DKIM was introduced, there was a 25 year SMTP history. We can't introduce a standard today and expect all SMTP servers to support it instantly. So both SPF and DKIM are "complimentary" mechanisms. i.e. Domain owners voluntarily support SPF and/or DKIM to help the receiving mail servers.</p>
                    <p>Modern mail servers validate SPF and DKIM records, rejects the mail ONLY when the validation result is "FAIL". If the validation result is "NEUTRAL" (i.e. SPF and DKIM are not configured), then the mail rejection will not happen. </p>
                    <p>The prior art says "rejects the e-mail message if invalid". This means the system works as a typical modern mail server. i.e. The mail will be rejected if the SPF or DKIM validation results in "FAIL"</p>
                    <p>My system works very differently. Both SPF and DKIM are "mandatory" mechanisms. i.e. The domain owner MUST configure those records. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>We reject both "FAIL" and "NEUTRAL" mails. Put it this way, we accept only when the mail result is "PASS". That's what "Must Pass" means in the above screenshot. </p>
                    <p>I forced all the sending domains to configure SPF/DKIM record. So the system works like "accepts the e-mail message ONLY when valid". That's what Apple copied here. </p>
                    <p>There is a difference between "rejects the e-mail message if invalid" and "accepts the e-mail message ONLY when valid". The former works in the following principle. "ALL MAILS MUST BE ACCEPTED UNLESS PROVEN GUILTY". The latter works in the following principle. "ALL MAILS MUST BE REJECTED UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT". </p>

                    <p>SPF record is stored in the root path. i.e. A query like "dig TXT facebook.com" would reveal whether the domain support SPF or not. </p>
                    <p>But for DKIM the path looks like this. "dig TXT selector._domainkey.facebook.com". The "selector" part is an arbitrary string. It can be anything. You need to have the full email message to check whether the domain support DKIM or not. This is why my "original" version is asking the domain owner to send a test email to a randomly generated email address. Apple is going for my amended version.</p>

                <h2>What is AntiTrust?</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        The word "antitrust" dates from the late 1800s, when powerful companies
                        dominated industries, working together as "trusts" to stifle competition.
                        Thus, laws aimed at protecting competition have long been labeled
                        "antitrust." Fast forward to the 21st century: you hear "antitrust" in news
                        stories about competitors merging or companies conspiring to reduce
                        competition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The FTC enforces antitrust laws by challenging business practices that
                        could hurt consumers by resulting in higher prices, lower quality, or
                        fewer goods or services. We monitor business practices, review potential
                        mergers, and challenge them when appropriate to ensure that the market
                        works according to consumer preferences, not illegal practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What kinds of business practices interest the Bureau of Competition? <br>
                        In short, the very practices that affect consumers the most: mergers,
                        agreements among competitors, restrictive agreements between
                        manufacturers and product dealers, and attempts by monopolists to
                        thwart new competitors. The FTC reviews these and other practices,
                        looking at the likely effects on consumers and competition. We ask:
                        Would they lead to higher prices, inferior service, or fewer choices for
                        consumers? Would they make it more difficult for other companies to
                        enter the market?
                    </p>

                <h2>Sherman Antitrust Act</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The Sherman Act broadly prohibits (1) anticompetitive agreements and (2) unilateral conduct that monopolizes or attempts to monopolize the relevant market. The Act authorizes the Department of Justice to bring suits to enjoin (i.e. prohibit) conduct violating the Act, and additionally authorizes private parties injured by conduct violating the Act to bring suits for treble damages (i.e. three times as much money in damages as the violation cost them). Over time, the federal courts have developed a body of law under the Sherman Act making certain types of anticompetitive conduct per se illegal, and subjecting other types of conduct to case-by-case analysis regarding whether the conduct unreasonably restrains trade.</p>
                    <p>The law attempts to prevent the artificial raising of prices by restriction of trade or supply. "Innocent monopoly", or monopoly achieved solely by merit, is perfectly legal, but acts by a monopolist to artificially preserve that status, or nefarious dealings to create a monopoly, are not. The purpose of the Sherman Act is not to protect competitors from harm from legitimately successful businesses, nor to prevent businesses from gaining honest profits from consumers, but rather to preserve a competitive marketplace to protect consumers from abuses.</p>

        <h1 class="text-primary mb-4 text-center" style="line-height: 1.3;">What Apple doing wrong?</h1>
        <div class="border-bottom pb-3 mb-4">
            <h2>Monopolizing Actions</h2>
            <p>Apple is using their "App Store" as leverage to monopolize the market. They are forcing the developers to offer "Sign in with Apple" when "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with Facebook" offered. </p>
            <div class="shadow-lg rounded mb-3">
                <img class="img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/conflict.png" >
            </div>
            <p>One of the well known anti-trust case is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">United States v. Microsoft Corporation</a>, where Microsoft used "windows" as leverage to capture the browser market share. The issue central to the case was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship Internet Explorer (IE) web browser software with its Windows operating system. Bundling them is alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft's victory in the browser wars as every Windows user had a copy of IE. It was further alleged that this restricted the market for competing web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Opera), since it typically took a while to download or purchase such software at a store. </p>
            <p>Apple is doing the same thing here. But with their "App Store".</p>
            <p>One need to evaluate this case carefully. For "Sign in with Apple", the competitor is not "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Facebook". It is "Sign In with Dombox (Teleport)", the original product. If Apple capture that market with their power, then it's going to be big loss for us, especially when we put all the work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-bottom pb-3 mb-4">
            <h2>Deceptive Acts</h2>
            <div class="shadow-lg rounded mb-3">
                <img class="img-fluid rounded-lg" src="../assets/images/apple/prohibited.png" >
            </div>
            <p>Apple need to notify the companies that they are not liable for patent infringement damages. And no sane company would be interested in being liable for other company's illegal activities. So they are wording it like "You may not incorporate Sign in with Apple into a website or app that .... Infringes or violates the intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights of another;". Now a person who is going to configure "Sign in with Apple" button on their website or app, would find that as a reasonable "ethical" statement. </p>
            <p>Sign in with Apple JS is served directly from Apple's website. Developers not gonna read the code. So they buried a lengthy license in their <a

        <div class="border-bottom pb-3 mb-4">
            <h2>Thwarting Innovation</h2>
            <p>Apple copied only a part of my work. So consumers are ending up with a cheap replica of my work. Here are some of the innovative aspects they are gonna miss.</p>
            <ul class="mb-0">

        <div class="border-bottom pb-3 mb-4">
            <h2>Economical Issues</h2>
            <p>Here are some of the popular companies who supports "Sign in with Apple": Adobe, Airbnb, Dropbox, Groupon, Medium, Meetup, Spotify, Vimeo, WordPress. These companies are contributing a lot to the economy.</p>
            <p>These companies are not aware of the fact that "Sign in with Apple" is a copied product.</p>
            <p>There is a quote that goes like this. "Speed has never killed anyone. Suddenly becoming stationary, that's what gets you". If "Sign in with Apple" breaks, Apple gonna cause a global economic meltdown since Apple continuously forcing the developers to use a stolen version of my work by using their "App Store" as leverage.</p>
            <p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://benpackard.github.io/blog/2020-01-28-sign-in-with-apple/">this developer</a>, "Sign in with Apple" is the current #1 product when it comes to registration. Just imagine the amount of damage Apple gonna cause to the economy if "Sign in with Apple" breaks.</p>
